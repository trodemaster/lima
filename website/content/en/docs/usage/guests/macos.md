| ⚡ Requirement | Lima >= 2.1, macOS, ARM  |
|-------------------|-----------------------------|

Running macOS guests is experimentally supported since Lima v2.1.

{{< tabpane text=true >}}
{{% tab header="macOS only" %}}
```bash
limactl start template:macos
```
{{% /tab %}}
{{% tab header="With Homebrew" %}}
```bash
limactl start template:homebrew-macos
```
{{% /tab %}}
{{< /tabpane >}}

The user password is randomly generated and stored in the `~/password` file in the VM.
Consider changing it after the first login.

```bash
limactl shell macos cat /Users/${USER}.guest/password
```

## Difference from Linux guests
- Password login is enabled
- Password-less sudo is disabled, except for `/sbin/shutdown -h now`
- Several features are not implemented yet. See [Caveats](#caveats) below.

## Suppressing first-login setup screens

By default, macOS shows a series of setup wizard screens (Setup Assistant /
mini-buddy) on the first GUI login. For automated or headless-style macOS VMs
this is inconvenient. Set `vmOpts.vz.suppressFirstLoginSetup: true` to have
Lima pre-populate the relevant preference plists during provisioning, before
any GUI session starts, so the setup screens are skipped automatically:

```yaml
vmOpts:
  vz:
    suppressFirstLoginSetup: true
```

This writes `com.apple.SetupAssistant.plist` into the guest user's home
directory and pre-configures `com.apple.SoftwareUpdate` system preferences so
that the "Update Mac Automatically" dialog is also suppressed. The preferences
are written as root (via the Lima guest agent) before first login, so macOS
reads them as the authoritative initial state and does not reset them.

**Default:** `false` — setup screens are shown as normal.

## Caveats
- No support for turning off the video display.
- No support for automatic port forwarding.
  Use `ssh -L` to manually set up port forwarding, or,
  use the [`vzNAT`](../../config/network/vmnet.md#vznat) network to access the guest by its IP.
- No support for installing custom `caCerts`
